# ShapeMamba-EM
------
This is the official repository for the paper [ShapeMamba-EM: Fine-Tuning Foundation Model with Local Shape Descriptors and Mamba Blocks for 3D EM Image Segmentation](https://papers.miccai.org/miccai-2024/paper/0151_paper.pdf).

## Requirement
#### Environmental Requirements

- Python=3.10
- torch==2.0.1
- cuda==11.7
- mamba-ssm

#### Installation
Clone this repository and then install the dependencies.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:EmmaSRH/ShapeMamba-EM.git
conda create -n shapemamba python=3.10
conda activate shapemamba
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
cd ShapeMamba-EM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training
Before start, Download the checkpoint from [ckpt section](https://github.com/uni-medical/SAM-Med3D#-checkpoint) and move the pth file into `SAM_Med3D/ckpt/` (We recommand to use `SAM-Med3D-turbo.pth`).
The dataset format is the same as [nnU-Net-style dataset](https://github.com/uni-medical/SAM-Med3Dhttps://github.com/uni-medical/SAM-Med3D?tab=readme-ov-file#1-prepare-your-training-data-from-nnu-net-style-dataset)
```sh
cd ShapeMamba-EM
python train.py --multi_gpu
```
We use 8 A800 GPUs to train our full model.

## Inference

```sh
python validation.py --seed 2023 -vp results/path -cp pth/path -tdp test/data/path --save_name save/name
```
